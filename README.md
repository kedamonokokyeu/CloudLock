‚òÅÔ∏è CloudLock ‚Äî Automated AWS S3 Auditing Service

CloudLock is a full-stack web application that automates SOC 2, ISO 27001, and HIPAA-style compliance checks across AWS S3 buckets.
It connects securely to your AWS account (via IAM Role ARN or JSON uploads), runs detailed policy + ACL audits, and exports a clean CSV report identifying security misconfigurations, public access, missing encryption, and more ‚Äî all within seconds.
